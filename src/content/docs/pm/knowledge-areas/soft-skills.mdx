When we talk about soft skills we are talking about human-to-human interaction. Every project is done by humans for humans and it is required
for every project manager to have good soft skills to build successful teams, maintain a healthy atmosphere in these teams, and of course, build
successful products. A good project manager never stops improving their/or her emotional intelligence.

## The most critical soft skills for Project Managers:

### 1. **Cast a vision.**
As a project manager, it is very important to cast a vision for a team. Let the team know where are we going, why are we
doing what we are doing, and discuss how we are going to do it. A good project manager has a **clear vision** of the project. It also includes
the ability to lead the team so that everyone in the team works as a whole. The project manager should also be able to inspire the team in
both good and hard times. Without a clear vision and a clear blueprint of actions, it is very hard to earn the respect of the team members.
### 2. **Simplifying complex things and topics.**
A good project manager should be able to **make complex things easy** for the team. It includes
**teaching and educating** the team when necessary. Try to explain the topics and tasks in the simple way possible and make everything
clear and easy to understand for the team. Use whiteboards and other visual materials to keep everyone on the same page and to deliver
the information in the quickest and in an efficient way. Documenting and writing user stories is not enough, you need to be talking and
explaining every aspect using your emotional intelligence.
### 3. **Collaboration.**
Before starting a project it is always good to have ice-breaking facilities with everyone. Talk to every team member
individually if possible to get to know them well, because some of the members may find it uncomfortable to talk among the team. Don’t
push developers too hard to talk a lot, a lot of them are introverts in their characters, so respect their choices and try to make an individual
approach to each of them. In brainstorming workshops, there will be some people who always dominate with their loud ideas and as a
result, some of the greatest ideas can be lost.
You can use the [round-robin](http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/news/round-robin-brainstorming/) method in such meetings to get everyone involved.

### 4. **Influencing.**
When you are responsible for a team you are going to influence the members in either a good or bad ways. Great project
managers understand that they are being watched by team members and try to influence the team in the best way. Being a good influencer starts
by being **self-aware** and setting the right examples. For instance, if you want everyone to be on time for meetings, you should not be late
yourself.

### 5. **Attentive listening.**
The best way to learn about someone is to listen to them carefully. There is 3 kind of listening: **internal, focused, and
global.** Internal listeners focus on the things that are going to affect themselves and ignore other things when they are listening, focused listeners
put themselves in the mind of a speaker, and global listeners build on a level with body language when they are listening. You want to be a global
listener if you really want to make emotional contact with the person speaking to you. Try to understand the **cause of their problems** first before
giving them advice or offering some help. [Maslow's hierarchy of user needs](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-guide-to-the-5-levels-of-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) can help you identify the needs of the person that is speaking to you
and to take any action for helping them.

### 6. Facilitating.
A good Project manager should be able to run effective meetings and workshops. In order to conduct effective workshops you
should pay attention to the following:
1. **Goal**(or goals) of the facility - Make it clear to everyone the “why” of the facility you are conducting. Why is everyone there and what
outcome do you want to get from this facility?
2. **Rules** - Set rules that help you keep everyone on the same page and attentive in workshops.
3. **Timing** - Nobody likes long meetings, make sure you set the timing right, if you make team members bored with long - unproductive
meetings, nobody will ever show interest in your facilities.
4. **Assisting** - Make sure to have someone in the team who helps you with facilities, for instance, someone who takes control of timing when
you are busy explaining hot topics.

**Process of effective facilitation:**

### 7. Conflict Resolution.
Almost all projects have conflicts. When some level of conflict is good and drive the need for improvement and gives
good ideas, we need to make sure that they don’t become a world war where everyone tries to destroy each other. There are different levels of
conflicts, some are good and some are very dangerous if not resolved on time.

**Plan for Managing conflicts**

<Image alt="Conflict resolution" src={`${path}/conflicts.png`} />

- [x] Educate yourself
- [x] Educate your team that conflicts will occur and it is normal, and sometimes very good to resolve problems and come up with the best ideas
- [x] Understand the Tuckman’s stages of group development in order to know where you are (You can get info about it in Team building and
Team development ):

<Image alt="Tuckman's team development model" src={`${path}/tuckmans.jpeg`} />

- [x] Understand the type of the occurring conflicts in the project lifecycle, understand in which step are you with your team

**Determine whether to Stop or Fuel the conflict by categorizing the conflict into 5 levels of conflicts:**

1. Problem to solve - sharing info
2. Disagreement - personal protection
3. Contest - Must win
4. Crusade - protecting one’s group
5. World war - must destroy the other

**Resolving Conflicts**

In order to effectively and safely resolve a conflict, we must first understand the level of the conflict and take quick actions based on them.
**Listening to and trying to understand the conflicting sides individually and separately will help to identify the root causes of the
conflict.** When you get the facts and causes you should use your reasoning to identify what is the best choice and explain it to the team in a way
that does not hurt anybody.

**How to deal with the difficult people**

- [x] Learn your habits and character. PM must be self-aware, unbiased, humble, and calm, don’t let them feel it even if you are filled with anger
get rid of the pride of a boss.
- [x] Don’t escalate the issue to the management too fast, instead see it as a psychological project that you need to tackle, this is hard but fun.
- [x] Listen to the difficult person. Most of the time they don’t like to talk to you or ignore you and it is ok. Don’t rush, try to go with them for lunch or
have a friendly talk first, and don’t go to the discussion of the problem immediately. All people have feelings, when they start feeling
comfortable enough with you then they will start telling you the reasons themselves or you can ask them to step by step.
- [x] Understand the reasons why they are acting this way, there can be several reasons
  * The wrong role, no training or support
  * Tasks they hate or do not want to do
  * Unclear goals or tasks
  * Unrealistic deadlines with no flexibility, not including them in the task assessment process
  * Not being listened to when they try to give input to the project
- [x] Once you identify the reason you can try to fix the problems and see what happens
- [x] Unfornutaley there will be cases where none of the methods work, if you tried everything and that did not work, and if the person you are
working with is toxic and disturbing others in a team then you can try to escalate the issue to the delivery managers.
