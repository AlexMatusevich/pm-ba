## What is Project Schedule Management?
**Project Schedule Management** includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.

## What is a Gantt Chart?
A **Gantt chart** is a bar chart that provides a visual view of project tasks scheduled overtime.

### How to Make a Gantt Chart?

* Make a task list with all the tasks that are needed to complete your project
* Define the start and end dates for each task
* Create a project timeline based on the duration of tasks
* Identify task dependencies
* Fill out the bar chart timeline with your tasks
* Assign tasks to your team members
* Set milestones
* Identify the critical path

## What is the Critical Path Method (CPM)?
A **critical path** in project management is the longest sequence of activities that must be finished on time in order for the entire project to be
complete.

### Why use the critical path method?

Here are some reasons:

* **Improves future planning:** CPM can be used to compare expectations with actual progress. The data used from current projects can inform
future project plans.
* **Facilitates more effective resource management:** CPM helps project managers prioritize tasks, giving them a better idea of how and where
to deploy resources.
* **Helps avoid bottlenecks:** Bottlenecks in projects can result in lost valuable time. Plotting out project dependencies using a network diagram,
will give you a better idea of which activities can and can’t run in parallel, allowing you to schedule accordingly.

## What is PERT Network Diagram?
A PERT chart is a visual project management tool used to map out and track the tasks and timelines. The name PERT is an acronym for Project
(or Program) Evaluation and Review Technique.

### How Is a PERT Chart Different from a Gantt Chart?
PERT charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they offer a graphical view of a project’s tasks, schedule, and timelines. But Gantt charts are bar
graphs; PERT charts are free-form;

## What is Roadmap?
A roadmap is a high-level strategic overview of a significant business initiative. Roadmaps are typically used to manage the development of a
new product or the execution of a company-wide project.

### What are the benefits of having a roadmap?
Roadmaps help keep team members on the same page in terms of an initiative’s scope, objectives, and timeline. They also help those in charge
communicate objectives and share status updates quickly.

### To create a roadmap:
* **Prioritize project deliverables** based on dependencies and business objectives.
* **Estimate the effort and time required for each deliverable.** Remember to factor in resource and team availability as well as any risks that
may delay the project.
* **Add milestones for each deliverable.**
* **Layout the high-level tasks** that’ll lead up to the milestone on the timeline.

## What is WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)?

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifies tasks and deliverables associated with a project. Resources are identified for each item within the
WBS that facilitates budgeting as well as assignment of responsibilities. The WBS can be used to determine the critical path of the project and
create the project schedule.

### How to create WBS?
* To identify the project deliverables and sub-deliverables, and the achievements and sub-achievements. Each deliverable or achievement
must equal the sum of its sub-elements. The WBS can be represented either as a list or graphically.
* To determine the Critical Path. The exercise to determine the critical path of a project explores the dependencies or relationships between the
elements within the WBS. The critical path examines the duration to complete tasks rather than the effort. This ensures that issues such as
delivery lead time are taken into account when planning the project.
* To create the Schedule. Once the WBS has been created and the critical path is determined, all the components are in place to create the
schedule.
