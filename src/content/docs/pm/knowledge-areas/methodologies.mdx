## What is a methodology?

**The methodology** is a set of principles and practices that guide you in organizing your projects to ensure their optimum performance.

### How do you choose the right project management methodology?

There are lots of factors that will impact which methodology is right for the project, team, and organization. Here’s a quick breakdown of some of
the key considerations that can help to decide:

- **Cost and budget:** On a scale of $ to $$$, what sort of budget are you working with? Is there room for that to change if necessary, or is it
essential that it stays within these predetermined limits?
- **Team size:** How many people are involved? How many stakeholders? Is your team relatively compact and self-organizing, or more sprawling,
with a need for more rigorous delegation?
- **Ability to take risks:** Is this a huge project with a big impact that needs to be carefully managed in order to deliver Very Serious Results? Or
is it a smaller-scale project with a bit more room to play around?
- **Flexibility:** Is there room for the scope of the project to change during the process? What about the finished product?
- **Timeline:** How much time is allotted to deliver on the brief? Do you need a quick turnaround, or is it more important that you have a
beautifully finished result, no matter how long it takes?
Client/stakeholder collaboration: How involved does the client/stakeholder need — or want — to be in the process? How involved do you
need — or want — them to be?

## Different types of methodologies

### 1. Waterfall

Waterfall is one of the simplest approaches to project management. It refers to a sequential process. It’s called a waterfall system because the
tasks flow down, and a task can only be started if the previous task was completed. There are no overlaps, so the requirements of each task
should be crystal-clear. This approach is often used in software development, and can be depicted as follows:

<Image alt="Waterfall" src={`${path}/waterfall.png`} />

**Try Waterfall project management methodology if:**

* The end goal of the project is clearly defined — and isn’t going to change.
* The stakeholders know exactly what they want (and it isn’t going to change).
* The project is consistent and predictable (i.e. isn’t going to change).
* The industry needs extensive project tracking or documentation.

**Waterfall project management methodology might not be for you if:**

* The project is liable to change.
* You don’t have a full picture of all the requirements before you start.
* You need to do continuous testing or adapt to feedback during the process

### 2. Agile

<Image alt="Agile" src={`${path}/agile.png`} />

The word agile refers to progressing quickly. This methodology helps you stay flexible while you’re able to respond to changing requirements. In
contrast to the waterfall method, the agile approach lets you implement required change requests, even late in the process. Deliverables are
frequently completed, and the overall objective is to improve customer satisfaction by constantly delivering small portions of the overall outcome.

The [manifesto for agile software development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) consists of 12 guiding principles.

<Image alt="Agile Manifesto" src={`${path}/agile-manifesto.png`} />

**Try Agile project management methodology if:**

* The project is liable to change.
* You’re not sure at the outset what the solution will look like.
* You need to work quickly, and it’s more important that you see speedy progress than perfect results.
* Your stakeholders or client needs (or wants) to be involved at every stage.

**This project management methodology isn’t for you if:**

* You need a lot of documentation (for example, if you’ll be bringing new people on-board during the project).
* You need a predictable deliverable, and you need to be crystal clear about what that looks like from the outset.
* Your project can’t afford to change during its course.
* You have strict deadlines or deliverables that you need to stay on top of.

### 3. Scrum

<Image alt="Scrum Process" src={`${path}/scrum-process.jpg`} />

**Scrum** is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

**Scrum Pillars**
<Image alt="Scrum Pillars" src={`${path}/scrum-pillars.png`} />

**Scrum Values**
<Image alt="Scrum Values" src={`${path}/scrum-values.png`} />

**Scrum Roles**
<Image alt="Scrum Roles" src={`${path}/scrum-roles.png`} />

**Developers** are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
**The Product Owner** is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may
vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
**The Scrum Master** is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum
theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

**Scrum Events**
<Image alt="Scrum Events" src={`${path}/scrum-events.png`} />
<Image alt="Scrum Events Table" src={`${path}/scrum-events-table.png`} />

**When to use Scrum:**
* Projects that consist of teams of less than ten people who need a flexible approach to deliver a product or service.
* High probability of changes. The client is open to innovation
* Requirements are not clearly defined
* The Product Owner is available
* Time and Materials/Dedicated team contract type highly preferable

### 4. Kanban

Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual
work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through
it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.

**Kanban Process**
<Image alt="Kanban" src={`${path}/kanban-process.png`} />

**Basic Principals**

* Visualization of the workflow
* Reduce waste (progress and status)
* Shared information
* Transparency
* Work In Progress (WIP) limits
* Reduce waste (defects, time for merging)
* Improves quality
* Improves flow for single work item

**Lead Time VS Cycle Time**
<Image alt="Lead Time" src={`${path}/lead-time-vs-cycle-time.png`} />

**Scrum vs Kanban**
<Image alt="Scrum vs Kanban" src={`${path}/scrum-vs-kanban.png`} />

**When to use**

* Changes in priorities
* Small and equal pieces of work
* Focus on fast and smooth continuous workflow
* No pre-determined delivery dates

### 5. Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme programming is a lightweight, efficient, flexible and software development centric agile principle. It mostly focuses on good development
practices and source code and technical quality whereas Scrum at the project management level focuses on prioritizing work and getting
feedback. The main principles of XP are simplicity, communication and feedback(fail fast & learn fast).

**Process and Phases.**

* **Release planning**
* **Iteration**
* **Release**

<Image alt="Extreme Programming" src={`${path}/extreme-programming.png`} />

**EP vs Scrum**

**XP Practices.**
* **Simple design**
* **Pair programming** - two developers sit together sharing one table and simultaneously work together. One of the developers writes code and
the second one helps with ideas and eliminates mistakes - leading to better code quality.
* **Constant testing** - Supported by unit testing and functional testing.
* **Continuous integration** - the practice of integrating the system every time when a developer completes a task(CI&CD)
* **Refactoring** - Implementing a feature without changing the behavior of the system
* **Test-Driven Development(TDD)** - Developers write the test first and then the code. The test should fail the first time because no code is
written.
* **Collective ownership** - even a single developer has a right to make changes and fix the issues in a code(by notifying other team members),
and everyone is responsible for the code of a project.

**Roles in XP:**

**Coach** - Acts as a mentor, guiding the process and helping the team stay on track, facilitator of the team that helps them become effective by
eliminating problems. \
**Customer** - A businessA business representative who provides the requirements, and priorities, and drives the business direction for the project. \
**Programmers** - Developers who build the product. \
**Testers** - Helps the customer define and write the acceptance tests for the user stories.

**When to use:**
* Dynamically changing software requirements.
* Small, co-located extended development team.
* The technology you are using allows for automated unit and functional tests.

The principle was introduced by **Kent Beck** who quoted: \
**“XP is a lightweight methodology for small to medium-sized teams developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing
requirements“.**

### 6. Nexus framework (Scaled Scrum)

<Aside title=" ">
  **Nexus** is a framework for *developing and sustaining*
  <Purple>scaled product delivery</Purple> initiatives.
</Aside>

**Nexus** builds upon Scrum,
<Green>extending it only where absolutely necessary to minimize and manage dependencies between multiple Scrum Teams</Green>
while promoting empiricism and the Scrum Values.

The Nexus framework inherits the purpose and intent of the Scrum framework as documented in the Scrum Guide.
<Orange>Scaled Scrum is still Scrum.</Orange> Nexus
<Red>does not</Red>
change the core design or ideas of Scrum, or leave out elements, or negate the rules of Scrum. Doing so covers up problems
and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless. The definition of Nexus is identified in the
<Blue>Nexus Guide.</Blue>

The <Blue>Nexus Guide</Blue> provides the following definition of Nexus:

A **Nexus** is a group of *approximately* **3 to 9** Scrum Teams that work together to deliver a single product; it is a connection between people and
things.

A Nexus has a <Green>single</Green> Product Owner who manages a <Green>single</Green>
Product Backlog from which the Scrum Teams work. The Nexus framework defines
the accountabilities, events, and artifacts that bind and weave together the work of the Scrum Teams in a Nexus.
<Orange>Nexus builds upon Scrum’s foundation,</Orange>
and its parts will be familiar to those who have used Scrum. It minimally extends the Scrum framework
<Red>only</Red>
*where absolutely necessary to enable multiple teams to work from a single Product Backlog to build an
<Blue>Integrated Increment that meets a goal.</Blue>*

<Aside type="caution" title=" ">
  While often counterintuitive, **scaling the value that is delivered** does **not always require adding more people. Increasing** the number
  of people and the size of a product **increases complexity and dependencies, the need for collaboration, and the number of
  communication pathways involved in making decisions. Scaling-down, reducing the number of people** who work on something,
  can be **an important practice in delivering more value.**
</Aside>

The <Green>goal</Green> of
<Green>Nexus is to scale the value that a group of Scrum Teams</Green>,
working on a single product, is able to deliver. It does this by reducing
the complexity that those teams encounter as they collaborate to deliver an integrated, valuable, useful product Increment at least once every
Sprint.

The Nexus Framework helps teams solve common scaling challenges like:
* reducing cross-team dependencies
* preserving team self-management and transparency
* ensuring accountability

<Aside title=" ">
  Nexus provides **opportunities to change** the process, product structure, and communication structure to reduce or remove
  dependencies.
</Aside>
