That’s true we have lots communications within the project. How it could be loaded depends on amount of people here. It’s really necessary to
plan communication from the start because with increasing people amount of communication channels increases in geometric progression.

### Plan Communication Management

Plan Communications Management is the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project communications activities based
on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organisational assets, and the needs of the project.

### Communication methods

* *Interactive communication.* Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time. It employs
communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms of social media, and videoconferencing.
* *Push communication.* Sent or distributed directly to specific recipients who need to receive the information. This ensures that the information
is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include
letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, blogs, and press releases.
* *Pull communication.* Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients to access content at their
own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or
knowledge repositories.

*As a result when we have a defined method of communication we need to decide how to build an effective communication plan. We may have
some teams but it’s not necessary to communicate to each other. To have an effective communication within a team we need to create a plan
with communication channels. Project manager is a responsible person for describing communication channels.*

### Manage Communication

Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management,
monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information. The key benefit of this process is that it enables an efficient and effective
information flow between the project team and the stakeholders. This process is performed throughout the project.
