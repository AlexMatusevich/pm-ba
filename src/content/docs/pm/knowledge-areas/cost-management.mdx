## What is Project Cost Management?

**Project Cost Management** includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling
costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.

## Cost Baseline VS Budget

### Cost Baseline
The Cost Baseline includes all the project activities/resources costs and the money set aside to respond to risks identified (i.e. known unknowns)
over time and it is usually represented as an S-curve

**Cost Baseline = Project Cost Estimates + Contingency Reserves**

### Cost Budget
The Cost Budget is the estimate of total amount of money required for carrying out the Project, including money set aside for identified and
unidentified risks (i.e. unknown unknowns)

The Cost Budget can be thought of as the Cost Baseline over time plus the Management Reserves

**Cost Budget = Project Cost Estimates + Contingency Reserves + Management Reserves**

## Earned Value Analysis

Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is an industry standard method of measuring a project's progress at any given point in time, forecasting its
completion date and final cost, and analyzing variances in the schedule and budget as the project proceeds.

1. The Planned Value (PV), (formerly known as the budgeted cost of work scheduled or BCWS)—that portion of the approved cost estimate
planned to be spent on the given activity during a given period.
2. The Actual Cost (AC), (formerly known as the actual cost of work performed or ACWP)—the total of the costs incurred in accomplishing
work on the activity in a given period. This Actual Cost must correspond to whatever was budgeted for the Planned Value and the Earned
Value (e.g. all labor, material, equipment, and indirect costs).
3. The Earned Value (EV), (formerly known as the budget cost of work performed or BCWP)—the value of the work actually completed.
