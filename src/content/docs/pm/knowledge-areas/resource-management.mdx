❗ There is a distinction between the skills and competencies needed for the project manager to manage
team resources versus physical resources. Physical resources include equipment, materials, facilities, and
infrastructure. Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources.

❗ The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management activities such as initiating,
planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the project manager is responsible for the team formation
as an effective group.

### Plan resource management

Plan Resource Management is the process of defining how to estimate, acquire, manage, and use team and physical resources. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project.

necessary to perform project work. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed.
