## Who is a Project Manager?
A **project manager** is a professional who organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within restraints like budgets and schedules.
Project managers are in charge of leading teams, defining goals, communicating with stakeholders, and seeing a project through to its closure.
Whether running a marketing campaign, constructing a building, developing a computer system, or launching a new product, the project manager is responsible for the success or failure of the project.

### What does a project manager do? Tasks and responsibilities.
A project is typically divided into five different phases: **initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, closure.**
