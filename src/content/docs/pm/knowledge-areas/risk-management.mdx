**Project risk management** is the process of identifying, analyzing and responding to any risk that arises over the project to help the project
remain on track and meet its goal.

## Types of risks:

* Positive risks
* Negative risks

Negative risks are part of a risk management plan, just as positive risk should be, but the difference is in approach. You manage and account for
known negative risks to neuter their impact, but positive risks can also be managed to take full advantage of them.

Positive risk can quickly turn to negative risk and vice versa, so project manager must be sure to plan for all eventualities with the team.

## Risk Management Process:

### 1. Plan Risk Management
**Plan Risk Management** the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.

The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:
* Risk strategy
* Methodology
* Roles and responsibilities
* Funding
* Timing
* Risk categories
* Definitions of risk probability and impacts
* Tracking
* Probability and impact matrix

### 2. Identify Risks
**Identify Risks** - the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and documenting their
characteristics.

Tools and Techniques:
* Expert Judgment (expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of similar projects or business areas)
* Data Gathering (brainstorming, checklists, interviews)
* Data Analysis (root cause analysis, assumption and constraint analysis, SWOT analysis, document analysis)
* Interpersonal and team skills
* Prompt lists
* Meetings

### 3. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
**Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis** - the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action by assessing their
probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.
* Define impact and probability (High, medium, law)

### 4. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
**Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis** - the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified individual project risks and other
sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.
* Define the probability of each risk ( High, medium, law or in % )

### 5 Plan Risk Responses
**Plan Risk Responses** - the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address overall project risk
exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks.

### 6 Implement Risk Responses
**Implement Risk Responses** - the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.

### 7 Monitor Risks
**Monitor Risks** - the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, tracking identified risks, identifying and
analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project
