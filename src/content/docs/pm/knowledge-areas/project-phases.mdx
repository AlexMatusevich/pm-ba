## Project Phases

*as PMBOK says - process groups

| Phase                    | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Initiation**  | This phase of project management marks the beginning of the project and is where the project charter is developed, and stakeholders are identified. |
| **Phase 2: Planning**    | This is where the project plan is developed. That means requirements (scope and work breakdown structure) are defined, costs are estimated, resources are determined. This is also where risk is identified and planned for, and where communications are built. |
| **Phase 3: Execution**   | This project phase is where the project is carried out, all while procuring resources and managing stakeholder expectations. |
| **Phase 4: Controlling/Monitoring** | This phase is often carried out simultaneously with execution because this is where quality, scope creep, and cost/time allocations are monitored. |
| **Phase: Closing**       | This stage of project management is where the project is finalised, the deliverable is given to the customer, stakeholders are told of the completion of the project, and all resources are released back to their resource managers. |

How to correlate project management process groups (phases) with knowledge areas? (What do we need in each phase of project?):
