Being able to build and develop strong and self-organizing teams is one of the most important skills for every project manager. In large
organizations where you work with different teams on different projects, you need to quickly form teams and be able to develop them quickly in
order to achieve organizational goals.

## Building teams

When building agile teams, the most important thing to remember is that you are a servant leader, and you are not managing projects but you are
managing people.

You need to make sure that your team is:

* self - organizing
* Self-directing
* have members that can perform different tasks which means they can help each other
* Small with fewer than 12 members

which means, **they determine how to do the work and they determine the paths of getting the work done.** The reason for **keeping agile
teams small** is that a small team size increases the likelihood that team **communication is focused and fast decisions** can be made. The
more team members you have the more inefficient communications you will have. The diagram below shows this in practice, where N is the
number of people in your team and as N increases, the number of communications will also increase consequently:

There is also a two-pizza-sized team rule which says if two - pizzas are not enough to feed your team then your team is too large.

## Team development

### Shu - Ha - Ri model

**Shu - Ha - Ri** is a model of skill mastery. When a person starts to work on a particular topic for the first time he obeys the rules and techniques
taught by mentors. Then as he/she progresses, a person moves forward and becomes more self-aware and masters the techniques taught by
mentors. As a person becomes T-shaped(expert) he/she will find individual ways and principles of doing things.

Steps of development in **Shu - Ha - Ri model:**
* Shu - obey
* Ha - Moving forward
* Ri - finding individual paths
This model is very useful in identifying and understanding the development of each individual in your team.

After you built your team and learned how every individual progresses in a particular skill you need some models and techniques to track overall
development in your team and as a leader help them establish a healthy relationship and cooperate productively. **Tuckman’s team
development model** is a very useful technique for achieving this goal.

### Tuckman's model

**Tuckman's model** explains that as the team develops maturity and ability, relationships establish, and leadership style changes to more
collaborative or shared leadership.

**5 stages of team development according to Tuckman:**
1. Forming - the team comes together and starts to get to know each other. There is not much conflict or communication.
2. Storming - team members start to have conflicts with each other. They start to learn about each other’s ideas and may not agree with
them. Most conflicts occur in this stage.
3. Norming - the team members begin to agree with each other on the best methods to build the deliverables. Generally, everyone is coming
to a consensus.
4. Performing - the team is performing well and is working without or with constructive conflict.
5. Adjourning - in this stage, the project is completed and the team is reassigned.

The steps above show the major steps in team development. **So what are the actions that the Project manager must take in every one of
these stages? Here is the answer:**

1. Forming -> **Directing leadership.** In this stage project manager must take the lead and provide the team with clear expectations and
consistent instructions.
2. Storming **Coaching.** In this stage, more conflict management is used. You need to support constructive conflicts and try to resolve
destructive conflicts. Being able to normalize manners and coaching team members is important in this stage.
3. Norming - **Supporting.** Be a servant leader and support their consensus. Provide learning opportunities and feedback. Monitor the energy
of the group. Being supportive is the most important thing in this stage.
4. Performing - **Delegating.** In this stage, you should minimize your intervention and let the team perform as a whole. Celebrate and
encourage group decision-making and problem-solving. Last but not least, you should provide opportunities to share knowledge across
the team.
5. Adjourning - Continue supporting and celebrating a team’s achievements. Provide opportunities for acknowledgments. Recognize change
and reward positive change in a team.
