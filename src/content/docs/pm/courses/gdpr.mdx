Every company and development team must make sure that the personal data of their employees and customers are safe and protected. Every
project manager needs to learn and help other team members understand the importance of personal data security.

Recently I finished a General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) compliance course. I learned a lot from this course and want to share the 8
essential steps for EU-based Businesses or Companies that work with the personal data of EU countries' citizens in becoming GDPR compliant.

1. **Map and audit data flow.** - You should know where all personal data is stored, what kind of personal data you are storing, and the list of
the devices in your network.
2. **Identify the third-party processes.** Identify your partners with whom you are sharing personal data and make sure that they are also
GDPR compliant and using data appropriately.
3. **Appoint Data Protection Officer.** Data Protection Officer is responsible for coaching other employees about data compliance, training the
members of staff who are involved in the data processing, carrying out regular security audits, and notifying individuals and relevant data
protection authorities. For instance, if a data breach happens, Data Protection Officer has to report it to data protection authorities within
72 hours.
4. **Adapt privacy notices and policies.** You need to explain to your users or customers clearly for what purposes you are using their data.
Your policies and notices should provide clear information about personal data usage.
5. **Stay responsive to access requests.** Anyone who gave you their info should be able to request to delete or alter their data.
6. **Understand at which steps stages and processes the personal info is accessed.** Identify every business process that accesses the
personal data and make sure that customers or users can make changes in every step of the process in which their data is accessed or
processed.
7. **Train your employees.** You should train your employees on handling personal data. They should follow safety regulations and be aware
of the consequences of failing them. As Bruce Schneier quoted: “Amateurs hack systems, professionals hack people“.
8. **Identify the reporting authority in case of a data breach.** A data breach is a security violation, in which sensitive, protected, or
confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. In case a data breach happens you
need to know where to report it. In the UK it is **ICO, BfDI** in Germany, **AEPD** in Spain, and so on.

This is the information I learned from the course, but you need to do more research on this topic for further knowledge. Failing the rules of GDPR
has severe consequences. Failing to follow the safety regulations can lead to

**up to €20 million (roughly $20,372,000), or 4% of worldwide turnover. So make sure your business is GDPR compliant.**
