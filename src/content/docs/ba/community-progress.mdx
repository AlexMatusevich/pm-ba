## BA community plan
- [ ] create a separate BA chat - so that everyone will be able to raise any BA questions there, we will discuss it and it will be more useful than direct 1-1 question-answer.
- [ ] schedule BA catch ups (bi-weekly?). Agenda could be:
    - [ ] 1st time - intro (meet everyone, purpose of the catch ups, potential agenda, etc.)
    - [ ] catch up - present BA community roadmap + do a ‘brainstorm’ session/discussion - which topic to include, generate meetups list for 1-3-6 months.
    - [ ] 1 time in month - meetup
