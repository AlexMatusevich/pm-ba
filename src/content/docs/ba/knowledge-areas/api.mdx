## APIs

### What is system integration?

System integration is the process of linking together different systems (components) to functionally cooperate as a whole. The right integration
can help to achieve more powerful functionality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, deliver greater value to the end-users and business.

Examples:
1. Integrating an online store with a payment provider will let you accept payments online.
2. Integrating Google/Facebook/VK/... as an authentication provider into your mobile app, will let your users quickly login without having to create
an account from scratch.

### What is API?
An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms
(contract) of this data exchange.

### What is REST API?
REST API stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural pattern for creating web services.

REST is a ruleset that defines best practices for sharing data between clients and the server. Itâ€™s essentially a design style used when creating
HTTP or other APIs that asks you to use CRUD functions only, regardless of the complexity. REST applications use HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`,
`DELETE`, and `PUT`. REST emphasizes the scalability of components and the simplicity of interfaces.

### What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data and is often used when data is sent from a
server to a web page.
