## Scope creep
As a project develops, there will often be unexpected details and challenges that your team will have to solve. However, you must keep in mind
that your budget and time both have limits. The tendency of a project to become larger and lose focus of its main goal is called scope creep.

A typical example of scope creep is when a client slowly requests more features without renegotiating pay rate, or when a client expects
additional functionality or services that were not originally agreed upon.

## Ways of capturing and 'locking' the boundaries of scope

### User story mapping
A user story map helps you arrange user stories into a useful model for understanding the functionality of a system, identifying holes and
omissions in your backlog, and effectively plan holistic releases that deliver value to users and business with through releases.

### Context diagram
A context diagram, sometimes called a level 0 data-flow diagram, is drawn in order to define and clarify the boundaries of the software system. It
identifies the flows of information between the system and external entities. The entire software system is shown as a single process.

### Use case diagram
A use case diagram is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and
different types of users the system has.

### Feature Tree
Feature Trees are high-level models organizing features into feature groups, capturing the entire scope of a project into a single model. Features
are listed into three separate levels of detail.

The highest level features are shown on Level 1 (L1), mid-level features are shown on Level 2 (L2), and low-level features are shown on Level 3
(L3).
