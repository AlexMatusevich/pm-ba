## Business Requirements
Business requirements are high level statements of goals, objectives, and outcomes that describe why a change has been initiated. They can
apply to the whole of an enterprise, a business area, or a specific initiative.

Every software application, conceptualized and initiated by an organization is meant to achieve a business goal like improving customer service,
increasing revenue by 10% every month etc.

A typical business requirement is shown below:

> We would like to automate our customer relationship management system so that we can offer better customer services so that
> the customer response time improves by 70% in the next 6 months.

Note that business requirements do not need to specify details as to how the objectives should be met.

## Stakeholder Requirements
Stakeholder requirements describe the needs of stakeholders that must be met in order to achieve the business requirements.

Stakeholders requirements are more individualistic. They serve as a bridge between business and solution requirements.

In in a bankâ€™s customer service management project, one of the stakeholders may state the following requirement:

> We would like to have a mechanism to monitor the response time for each and every customer support request on a daily basis
> in order to improve the response time. The report should be generated daily, monthly or on on-demand basis.
>
> A comparative report will be needed to see the trend.

## Solution Requirements
These requirements describe the capabilities and qualities of a solution that meets the stakeholder requirements. They provide the appropriate
level of detail to allow for the development and implementation of the solution. These requirements will be used by the engineering team to
develop the system.

Solution requirements are of two types:
* **Functional requirements:** Functional requirements are the expected features of the system. Features like registering a user, making an
online purchase etc.
* **Non-Functional requirements:** Non-functional requirements are the requirements which are related to the behavior of the system. While func
tional requirements define what the system is expected to do, non-functional requirements specify how the system should do it.

An illustration of functional requirements is shown below:
> The system should display customer last name as a link to their account history. \
> Upon navigating to the customer account history, the bank clerk can see the following details: \
> \- account number \
> \- remaining balance \
> \- pending transactions \
> \- past transactions \
> \- ...

Non-functional requirements can be of different types, below are a few examples:
> Any system response shall not exceed 3 seconds (performance)
> If the user fails to provide correct password 3 times, the system shall temporarily block their account (security)
>
> The system shall be able to support an annual growth of 15% on the number of transactions (scalability)

## Transition Requirements
Transition requirements describe the capabilities that the solution must have and the conditions the solution must meet to facilitate transition from
the current state into the future state, but which are not needed once the change is complete. They are differentiated from other requirements
types because they are of a temporary nature.

Examples of transition requirements are as follows:
> The users must be trained to be able to use the system effectively
> Previous years data must be migrated to the new system to generate comparative report
