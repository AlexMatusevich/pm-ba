A user story is a well-formed, short and simple description of a software requirement from the perspective of an end-user, written in an informal
and natural language. It is the main artifact used in the agile software development process to capture user requirements.

## Advantages of user stories

A well-formed user story can benefit the software development process in the following ways:
* **Fosters Collaboration:** Good User Stories due to their minimalist characteristic, inherently give way to collaboration among the product
development team, the Product Owner and the users of the product. They facilitate diverse business-technical discussions which lead to
innovative ways of solving customer's needs.
* **Brings User Closer:** By focusing on delivering highest customer value with each user story, the Agile teams are compelled to regularly
connect with and collaborate with end users or/and Product Owner.
* **Building Blocks of the Product:** With each customer value delivering User Story, the product is built incrementally. Building the product
incrementally allows to rapidly adjust it to a new direction. When sliced in smaller ideas to experiment, user stories allow for quick
implementation and user feedback.
* **Reduces project risks:** User stories are, at their very core, a user-centric tool for the product team. This helps to make sure that oversights
and scope creep are caught early on.

## Characteristics of good user stories
The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to
meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite

* **Independent** – Stories should not be dependent on other stories (sometimes it’s ok to have a sequential dependence between user stories)
* **Negotiable** – Stories should capture the essence of the requirement and should not represent a contract on how to solve it.
* **Valuable** – Stories should clearly illustrate value to the customer.
* **Estimable** – Stories should provide enough information so they can get estimated.
* **Small** – Stories should strive to be granular enough in scope that they may be completed in as little time as possible, from a few weeks to a
few days.
* **Testable** – Stories need to be understood well enough so that tests can be defined for them. An effective way to ensure testability is to define
user acceptance criteria for all user stories.
