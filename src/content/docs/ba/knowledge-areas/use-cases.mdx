title: Use Cases
---

A use case is a methodology used in business / system analysis to identify, clarify and organize system requirements. The use case is made up
of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a particular goal. The
method creates a document that describes all the steps taken by a user to complete an activity.

## Tips
### Make each step show an action
A use case is a story. Stories that donâ€™t move forward are boring (and hard to read). So, each step in the use case should show some progress
towards the eventual goal.

### Keep it between six and ten steps
When a use case is 6-10 steps long, your reader can absorb and understand it in a minute or two. If your use case is much longer than 10 steps,
reconsider the goal of the use case. Ask yourself how the actor completes that goal and see if you can break it in two.
