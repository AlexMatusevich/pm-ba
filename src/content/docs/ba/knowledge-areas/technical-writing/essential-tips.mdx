There exist a thousand essential and useful rules on how to create understandable Technical Documentation, that’ll be appreciated by end-users.
Here are mentioned just a few of them.

## 1. Trees/branches
It’s not easy to read a guide, that takes a few pages, esp. if that is a How-to article. So if you see, that your article is taking more pages/text, that
you expected, **divide** it into a series of articles.
How to measure/understand? – If your viewer/reader needs to scroll your page more, than 2-3 times (as usual, it means, your text is more than 1-

1.5 page), then better divide it into
In this case, **branches of a documentation tree** are recommended for creation. For more about documentation tree follow https://u6-itechart.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UPB/pages/261292066/Technical+Writing+Process#3.-Structure-information.

Obviously, **you should not divide lists** (such as this one, you are reading now) or **articles, dedicated to just one topic**, even if they exceed the
recommended length. Information delivery is of a top priority.

## 2. Parent Page
When you work with branches/ tree-structure, do not forget to create a **parent page** with cross-links and a quick description of child pages. In
addition, there is always a great idea to leave on a Parent Page a few **general words** about the section itself.

If you do not use a Parent Page, than you could give a **quick overview** with a not-detailed list of content just at the beginning of the article.

## 3. Search bar and Tags/Keywords

If your knowledge base contains numerous articles (as most of KBs), then **adding a search bar** will be a great choice, that’ll be definitely used by
your readers.

For you, as a Creator, your Knowledge Base may seem understandable and easy navigable. But don’t forget, that as usual a Reader comes to
your Knowledge Base not to investigate the whole structure/product, but to **find the definite answer** of how to accomplish some task. Make this
work as easy, as you could, thus encouraging your Customer/reader to visit your Knowledge Base again and again.

The same can be mentioned concerning **Tags and Keywords.**

With a help of tags a Viewer can **find more articles,** related to the sought-for theme.

## 4. Headings and Subheadings
When creating **Headings and Subheading**, do your best to find the best wording for them. By “best” in this case I mean than your (sub)heading
needs to be **short, precise, though easy to be understood.** A Customer needs to understand the topic of an article just at the first glance.

## 5. Cross links
So that to ease the search-for and navigation work, it is highly recommended to **use cross-links.** Such cross-links could lead to the different
parts of the same article, to another part of a Knowledge Base or even to an external resource.

For a Knowledge Base creator, cross-links help managing changes. When you, as a Technical Writer, rewrite an article or just make some
changes to it, with the help of cross-links, it is easy for you to look through all the related articles.

For a Viewer, again this helps in navigating through a Knowledge Base.

## 6. Related Articles
The usability is the same, as for cross-links, mentioned in the above written item.

Related Articles can be of 2 types:

* **At the Beginning of an article.** Such a section contains links to some other articles that a User is better to digest before reading the current
article.

* **At the End of an article.** Here a Technical Writer can place information, that can be useful as further reading.

## 7. Visualization (pictures, tables, infographics, screenshots)
The ways of information visualizing are endless. Let’s just mention some of them:

* **tables** help in structuring information.
<Image alt="Visualization Tables" src={`${path}/visualization-tables.png`} />

* with the help of **infographics,** information is presented in enjoyable, engaging way.

* **diagrams** are very similar to infographics, but use less text and could easily present both simple processes and complicated structures

* **pictures** are commonly used for visual presenting any info.

## 8. Bulleted and numbered lists
The same as for visualization, **bulleted and numbered lists** ease the comprehension of the text. What’s more, such lists prompt an author to
use the simplest language without unnecessary words addition.

Compare the **non-listed** text VS the **listed** text
<Image alt="Delivery options 1" src={`${path}/delivery-options-1.png`} />
<Image alt="Delivery options 2" src={`${path}/delivery-options-2.png`} />

Common Types of Lists
* Bullet Lists: use when order of listed items is not important.
* Numbered Lists: use when order is important, such as steps in instructions.
* In-sentence Lists: use when you want to maintain sentence structure and paragraphing, and have a short list (2-4 items).
* Labelled Lists: use when the listed items require some explanation or amplification (like this one)
* Nested Lists: use when listed items have sub-lists (list within a list).

<Aside title=" " type="caution">
  However, you need to be careful and not to overload a text with visualization. That’s just a tool, not the essence of the documentation.

## 9. Add feedback gathering form on each page
It is not an easy task to collect a feedback from real end users. **Add feedback gathering** form at each page so that users can manually choose,
whether the page was helpful for them.

* The shorter and the simpler the language in this form, the better.
* Put this form in a separate section (as in a screenshot below) or post it right after the article.
* The form should be easily noticed, but shouldn’t distract end-user’s attention from an article.

Finally, while creating a documentation base, always keep in mind your end users. Remember, that knowledge base is often created for an active
usage. **Do not create documents just for having documents.**

Good Luck!
