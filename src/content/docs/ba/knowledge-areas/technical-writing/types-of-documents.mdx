During a work on a project, a BA works with and collects a wide range of information. If this information is stored only in a BA/team heads, then
there exists a risk of losing some knowledge.

That is why, it is a standard practice, when a BA creates a **project knowledge base**, thus gathering, systemizing, and managing all the
documentation on the project. In this case, a Business Analyst plays a role of a Technical Writer.

Here are the most popular ones in a tech-related sphere that can be created by a BA/Technical Writer:
* Project Knowledge Base;
* FAQ;
* Manual;
* Guides, How-tos.

## Internal and external knowledge base

### Internal

These resources can come in different formats, but they aim to help answer any question your team members may have. This can include
information on objectives, requirements, internal policies, formal procedures, new product or hardware updates, release dates, promotions,
troubleshooting, company values, technical specifications, Standard Operating Procedures, onboarding guides, and many more.

### External (documentation for end users).

The documentation, created for end-users, should explain in the simplest way possible, how the software can help solve users problems.

1. **The quick start guide** provides an overview of the product’s functionality and gives basic guidelines on how to use it.

software requirements, detailed description of the features and full guidelines on how to get the most out of them, example inputs and outputs,
possible tips and tricks, etc.;

4. **The troubleshooting guide/How-to/Task-oriented doc** gives end-users information on how to find and resolve possible issues that might
arise when using the product. Usually, it is described in a How-to – way or as a Guidance with concrete steps.
