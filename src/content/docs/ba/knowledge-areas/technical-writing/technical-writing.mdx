## 1. Research information
Before creating any article, a Tech Writer needs **thoroughly explore** the information. You cannot create a detailed, structured document on a
topic/a feature, you do not understand and know

## 2. Collect and analyze information
While exploring the information, **create drafts** and **write down** your thoughts. That is your future basis, that won’t let you forget any essential
detail or tiny, but important thing to mention.

## 3. Structure information
There are numerous ways of representing complicated structured with many documents.

The most widespread variant is, probably, a **documentation tree**. It allows easily arrange documentation with a complicated structure. Each
section in such a tree can be divided into numerous branches, branches can be further divided into sub branches etc.

  **Confluence-structure** gives an opportunity to easily create documentation tree for a project information.

Structure can be created with the help of tabs (horizontal or vertical), with further allocation of articles according to their topics.

On some websites, **graphical visualization** can be used for easier navigation and comprehension:

## 4. Present and refine the structure to stakeholders and/or software developers (optional)

It is great, that you have an opportunity to **present** your final structure **to your stakeholders,** when it is ready. Their critical eye on the final
structure can be useful.

However, explain stakeholder, that the structure is not a stable thing. They should understand that during the further work, a structure can be
reworked and change, the way it looks now.

Don’t forget to invite to the presentation **the developers,** that have been working on the feature/project (again, if you have such an opportunity).
If you are a non-technical specialist, there is always a chance, that you have overlooked something or understood not in the exact way. Don’t
give yourself a chance to mistake.

## 5. Prepare final delivery

There exist **2 variants** of documentation delivery. According to the first one, each document is published, **when it is ready ready.** This approach
is used, when there is an urgent need to publish the answers to some widely asked questions. It is common for internal documentation or for
startups, which are aiming at delivering few articles as far as possible.

The second approach presupposes, that the documentation should be published only when **the whole documentation is ready** (or at least the
whole chapter/branch with the corresponding articles). That is usual for the external documentation, published for customers.

## 6. Publish.
As usual, end-users **are not informed** about the publication of the documents. However, if FAQ-section or Help center are the long-awaited
features, let your Users know about their release.

## 7. Manage documentation
The technical Writer’s work is not finished, when the documentation is ready and published. Whenever you have a few dozens of articles, or your
systems contains thousands of them, you need to conduct **further maintenance of the knowledge base.**

**Cross-links** and **Related Articles** can actively help in managing documentation changes (see the Tips-section).

**Plan** documentation work. Create the recurring events in your calendar with the appropriate. The more documentation you have, the more often
you need to look through

That is just an example of the ideal situation, of how a Technical Writer can perform the process of creating docs.

However, for some people it is easier to create documents occasionally, from time to time. That risky approach can lead to a messy, unstructured
documentation.
