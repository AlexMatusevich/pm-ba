## Who is a Stakeholder?
A stakeholder is a person, group or organization which has interests that may be affected by an initiative or has influence over it. \
Stakeholders can support or resist change, they can clarify or confuse requirements, and they have knowledge that the analyst needs to acquire.

## What Is Stakeholder Analysis?
Stakeholder analysis is a process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken
into account when developing and/or implementing a policy or program.

## Why Is this Analysis Useful?
Identifying the stakeholders is extremely important if conflicts are to be avoided later in the project. Many initiatives have been derailed when an
alternative point of view has emerged, sometimes at a late stage. Identifying the interested parties early on will help analysts to understand the
range of views, and, where necessary, handle the differences.

## Common artifacts produced as a result of stakeholder analysis

### Stakeholder Wheel
The stakeholder wheel is a powerful and easy to use tool that can help nearly any organization understand its relationships and opportunities
better. \
The wheel is used by looking systematically at each group and checking for the stakeholders that may exist there. In essence, the wheel is a
form of checklist that helps the analysts ensure that stakeholder groups are not missed. It also prompts the analysts to consider the different
constituencies with an interest in the project, and the nature of that interest – an aspect that is vital when analysing stakeholder views.

### Stakeholder Register
A stakeholder register provides a detailed list of names, with their respective roles, positions, organisations (if external to the client organisation),
requirements, expectations, influence and classification of importance. Together with RACI matrix (see below) this artifact is the most often
produced in the course of stakeholder analysis.

### Onion Diagram
An onion diagram is a convenient way of showing the stakeholders in a given scenario. It gets its name because the layout is similar to an onion.
At the center of the onion is the goal, product, or other whatever else the topic of the diagram may be. From that inner circle, outer circles are
drawn that represent stakeholders of decreasing significance.

### Power & Interest Matrix/Grid
The power& interest stakeholder grid is used to examine stakeholders’ specific roles to map the type of engagement requirements which will then
help to drive the stakeholder communication approaches. Stakeholders in this grid would fall under four quadrants, namely keep satisfied,
monitor, keep informed and manage closely.

### RACI Matrix
RACI matrix is a simple and elegant tool that helps everyone to keep track of their roles and responsibilities. This chart protects you from role
confusion and makes it way easier to run your projects smoothly. It’s simple and clear structure shows who does what on a high level and can be
especially helpful when creating a team charter.

**Responsible (R)**
“Responsible” refers to the person who actually completes the task – aka “the doer.” There always has to be at least one Responsible per each
task. If you are missing an R in any of the rows of the matrix – you have a gap that has to be filled immediately.

**Accountable (A)**
“Accountable” is the person who is ultimately answerable for the activity or decision to be made. This is someone who has the final authority over
the task – typically some kind of a manager or senior offices. Typically, you should have the minimum number of people accountable for every
task. In most projects, there will be only one person listed as “accountable.”

**Consulted (C)**
“Consulted” is the adviser for the given task or entire project. Normally, this is the subject matter expert whose opinion you seek before making
the final decision or action. Keep in mind that you should keep the number of C’s to the minimum for each row. Having too many consultants can
slow down the process significantly and add unnecessary deliberation and idle discussion. Too many C’s can raise the risk of poor performance.

**Informed (I)**
“Informed” are the people you keep updated on how the process is going. These would be the people who you will notify once the task is
completed and who will take action as the result of the outcome. There can be as many “informed” as necessary per process. You usually have
only a one-way communication with these people.
